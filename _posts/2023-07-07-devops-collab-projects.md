Quick post to announce that I created a new repo to store and share some of my personal projects. Over there I will publish some cool scripts, manifests, and documentation about my DevOps day-to-day work. The objective here is to improve knowledge share, which is one of my main goals with this blog.

Hope you can find some cool stuff very soon. And, of course, feel free to collaborate yourself.

Let's create a good and real DevOps culture.
