# How to contribute

First of all, always be respectful in the Issues, Wiki and Discussions areas.

Give preference to create well-structured and documented reviews and PRs, using markdown whenever possible.

## Issues

If you see any bugs or have any suggestions for improvements, be sure to open an issue to start a discussion and create a Pull Request to correct or change something in our code base.

Issues can be opened and/or fixed by anyone who wants to become a contributor to this repository.

### Changing locally

Create a Fork of the repository and make your changes. Then proceed with a PR so that these changes are present in our repository. When your PR is ready, I will review and confirm any changes that are necessary.

Forking is great so you can change more freely without changing the main repository.

Another way to do this is to create a branch to carry your commits and PRs.

### Branches

If you want to create a branch, please use the patterns below:

+ BUGS

Create a branch with the tag BUG:

> bug-YOUR-BRANCH

+ FEATURE AND IMPROVEMENTS

Create a branch with the tag FEATURE:

> feature-YOUR-BRANCH
