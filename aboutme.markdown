Hi, I am a Sysadmin since 2005 and a DevOps Engineer since early 2018. I just love to work with IT and to learn about new technologies and frameworks. Currently I am working from Portugal as a Devops Engineer and learning more about Python and Go languages to help my devops tasks. I really love to work with Kubernetes, Terraform and Jenkins, btw.

In my free time, I used to play a lot of videogames and watch some series. I also enjoy to spend some quality time visiting cool places and eating food in some good restaurants with my wife! 

If you want to contact me, plese leave a [message](mailto:natan.dias1@live.com).
